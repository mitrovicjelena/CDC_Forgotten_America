## Our Inspiration
By many measures, Kentucky is one of the hardest places to live in the United States. 54% of the counties in Kentucky are considered to be in persistent poverty (tied for second worst in the US), with over 20% of their respective populations having lived below the poverty line for the last 30 years. The economic challenges residents of Kentucky face are only exacerbated by the social vulnerabilities that plague their communities, especially in the eastern half of the state. We felt inspired to uncover the underlying reasons for these difficulties by using social vulnerability data from the Center for Disease Control.

## What it does
We created a ~5 minute video outlining the problem, our research process, and results regarding social vulnerability in eastern Kentucky.
We also created a report that covers this topic, especially our statistical methods used, in much greater detail that was not necessary for the ~5 minute video.
Lastly, we generated a dynamic tableau dashboard presenting various factors and their impact on eastern Kentucky.

## How we built it
We primarily utilized R for our data wrangling and statistical modeling. We used strictly tableau for our visualizations. For our video, we utilized green-screen technology to create a more immersive and interactive experience.

## Challenges we ran into
The initial exploratory data analysis phase of the project was our largest challenge. We did not officially determine our project scope until September 30, 2021 (Thursday). We spent all week exploring the data in an attempt to uncover riveting insight. Once we discovered the large disparity in social vulnerability that eastern Kentucky is facing we were confident in the scope. Since we did not officially determine the scope until Thursday, that only left us 3 days to put together our analysis and deliverables.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The accomplishment we are most proud of is that we believe our insight is specific and granular enough to have actual meaning. The struggles in eastern Kentucky we highlighted are addressable, but first diagnosing the problem is required. We believe our analysis sheds light on the otherwise forgotten portion of America.

## What's next for Forgotten America
While the patterns of social and economic vulnerability in eastern Kentucky paint a troubling picture, further research into the solutions is needed. Specifically, we recommend expanding analysis to the following areas:

1) Historical, political, and institutional factors that have contributed to the high rates of vulnerability throughout eastern Kentucky
2) Federal and state financial support given to Kentucky census tracts over the past several decades in comparison with funds given to similar tracts in other states
3) Allocation of funds spent on infrastructure, healthcare, food, and education throughout Kentucky
Census tracts in the same clusters as those in eastern Kentucky that have been able to make economic and social improvements for their populations
